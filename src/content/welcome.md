## Welcome!
My name is Jack Owen. I'm an aspiring writer of middle-grade and Young Adult fiction.
When writing I take inspiration from many, many different places and have learnt many interesting things. I'd like to share some of these things on Sketches & Scratches in the hopes they might inspire you too!
For now you can read articles on the art & artists which inspired my first novel Sketch.â€‹
Later I'll add some stuff on time travel & scientific theory from the research I did on my second book The Day Time Was Lost and also a section on animals & nature.

Be sure to check out the What I Write section to learn more about my books!
