            <h5>When writing I take inspiration from many, many different places and have learnt many interesting things.
                I'd like to share some of these things on Sketches & Scratches in the hopes they might inspire you too!</h5>
            <p>For now you can read articles on the art & artists which inspired my first novel Sketch.​</p>
            <p>Soon I will add some stuff on time travel & scientific theory from the research I did on my second book The Day Time Was Lost.</p>
            <p>Later on I will add a section on animals & nature.​</p>
